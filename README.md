# ✨📺Satwi's Sorting Visualiser📺✨

## What's the project about?👀👀
  A java Gui project that  helps you visualise how Sorting algos work and master DataStructures(hopefully)😁😋.
  
## Purpose👩‍🎓👨‍🎓
  This project's purpose was to help me and u for two purposes:
  1. I wanted to get a picture clear clarity on how sorting works.
  2. Practice my core Java concenpts. 

  ps: I have Internals cmg up soon :(  and I have 2 major Subjects : Oops in java and DataStructures. So, I thought that combining both concepts and making a project is cool :))


## Features💡🖍
  This project features many sorts including:
  ⭐ Bubble sort
  ⭐ Insertion sort
  ⭐ Selection sort
  ⭐ Merge sort
  ⭐ Fast Bubble sort(Efiicient algo)
  ⭐ Fast Selection Sort(Efficient algo)
    
  Later I plan to implement more sorts.
## Let's see who's wins🥇🥇:

You can now see the comparision between all the sorting algorithms and their speed for the same set of data:

## How to Download and use the code ⚙ 🛠:
```
1. Download as a zip file or clone the repo into your local repo in your system.
2. Extract the files into a new folder in your system.
3. Install Eclipse and do al the neccesary installments thereby.
4. Start a new project and add the folder into the project.
5. Run it
6. If u use Vs Code like me, then directly clone the repo and install required java compilers as extentions, and run.
(Rememeber u need to have JDK pre installed to be able to run on either eclipse or Vs code)
```
  You can change the speed at which the sorts operate as well as the size of the data set.
