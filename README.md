# Satwi's Sorting Visualiser

## What's the project about?
|  It helps you visualise how Sorting algos work.
  
## Purpose
  This project's purpose was to help me for two purposes:
  1. understand how to implement sorting algorithms and their use in real life.
  2. Practice my core Java. 

  ps: I have Internals cmg up soon :( , and I have 2 major Subjects : Oops in java and DataStructures.So, I thought that combining both concepts and making a project is cool :))


## Features
  This project features many sorts including:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Selection sort
  - Merge sort
    
  Later I plan to implement more sorts.
  
  You can change the speed at which the sorts operate as well as the size of the data set.
